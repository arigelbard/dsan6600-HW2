    "* Classification is one of the most common forms of supervised machine learning \n",
    "* In this homework we will explore \"model tuning\" for the case of a multi-class classification problem, as applied to the MNIST data set\n",
    "* `You can do this assignment in either Keras OR PyTorch` (or both), it is your choice.\n",

    "## Submission \n",
    "\n",
    "* You need to upload TWO documents to Canvas when you are done\n",
    "  * (1) A PDF (or HTML) of the completed form of the `HW-2.ipynb` document \n",
    "* The final uploaded version should NOT have any code-errors present \n",
    "* All outputs must be visible in the uploaded version, including code-cell outputs, images, graphs, etc\n",
